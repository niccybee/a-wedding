          Georgia & Nic Wedding Welcome to the official Astro blog starter
          template. This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled
          starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website, blog,
          or portfolio with Astro.
        </p>
        <p>
          This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
          astro.config.mjs file. You can customize your setup with Astro
          Integrations to add tools like Tailwind, React, or Vue to your
          project. Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:
          Edit this page in src/pages/index.astro Edit the site header items in
          src/components/Header.astro Add your name to the footer in
          src/components/Footer.astro Check out the included blog posts in
          src/pages/blog/ Customize the blog post page layout in
          src/layouts/BlogPost.astro Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to
          read the docs or join us on Discord to ask questions. Looking for a
          blog template with a bit more personality? Check out
