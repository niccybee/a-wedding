            Georgia & Nic Wedding Welcome to the official Astro blog starter
            template. This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled
            starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website, blog,
            or portfolio with Astro.
          </p>
          <p>
            This template comes with a few integrations already configured in
            your astro.config.mjs file. You can customize your setup with Astro
            Integrations to add tools like Tailwind, React, or Vue to your
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template: Edit
            this page in src/pages/index.astro Edit the site header items in
            src/components/Header.astro Add your name to the footer in
            src/components/Footer.astro Check out the included blog posts in
            src/pages/blog/ Customize the blog post page layout in
            src/layouts/BlogPost.astro Have fun!
          </p>
          <p>
